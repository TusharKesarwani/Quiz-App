# Project Description

As a Btech student with a passion for web development, I independently conceived and developed the "Quiz App" for entertainment purposes. This dynamic web application invites users of all backgrounds to engage in a fun and interactive quiz experience.

Key Features:
- User-Friendly Interface: The Quiz App offers a seamless and user-friendly experience with a light-themed interface that appeals to a broad audience.
- Responsive Design: Utilizing React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ensured the Quiz App's full responsiveness, enabling access from any device, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
- Engaging Quiz Flow: The app guides users through a captivating quiz journey, starting with a name and email submission. It presents a countdown timer, challenging users to answer 15 intriguing questions within 30 minutes.
- Interactive Navigation: Users can easily navigate between questions, allowing them to revisit previous questions and track their progress.
- Instant Scoring: Upon completing the quiz or when the timer expires, users receive an instant score report, showcasing their answers alongside the correct ones.
